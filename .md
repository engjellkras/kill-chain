# Kill chain

## Summarizing the Hutchins et al 2011 article about kill chain

<p>Kill chain is summarized as a process in which we find a adversary to engage and make it do what we want to. The US  military uses the letters F2T2EA which are short for 
find, fix, track, target, engage, assess. ; fix their location; track and observe; target
with suitable weapon or asset to create desired effects; engage adversary; assess effects (U.S. Department
of Defense, 2007). Relating to the concept kill chain has been made into 7 different phases: Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, 
Command and control, Actions on objectives. The essence of an intrusion is that the aggressor must develop a payload to breach a trusted boundary,
establish a presence inside a trusted environment, and from that presence, take actions towards their
objectives, be they moving laterally inside the environment or violating the confidentiality, integrity,
or availability of a system in the environment (Hutchins El Al, 2011).</p>

## Tactics, tools and procedures
<p>
  - Tactics work as the why in the ATT&CK technique or sub-technique. It explains why we are doing the certain action.
  A good example is why a person would might want to hack in to somebodys systems.

- Techniques are the how of the attack. There can be different attacking techniques depending on the system that we are trying to manipulate
  For example gathering victim host information can be a technique used during targeting.

- Sub-techniques are the same thing as techniques but the differnce is that sub-techniques are more specific about how,
  we will achieve our goal. Tecniques have many sub-techniques inside of them. For example in the technique we used are 4
  sub-tecniques. Hardware, Software, Firmware and Client configurations.

- Procedures works as the tools that we used during the attack. They could vary depending on the attack that we are planning to make.
  For example in the tecnique that i picked we could use system commands in Windows or Linux. We could also run Powershell scripts for collecting
  host information.</p>
